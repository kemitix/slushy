      We have read your story and we liked it. However, we haven't yet decided
      if we want to select it for inclusion in an upcoming issue. We appreciate
      your time, which is why we accept sim-subs, and encourage you to continue
      to submit your story to other markets. We will try to make a final
      decision as soon as possible and let you know.
    </p>

    <p>Please do let us know if you manage to place your story elsewhere.</p>
    <p>
      Yours,<br />
